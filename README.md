## Project Overview

This AI Conversation Simulator is a Python-based application that leverages the power of AI to simulate conversations between two virtual agents. The application is built using the Streamlit framework, offering an interactive user interface for users to observe and analyze AI-driven dialogues. The primary use case of this application is to demonstrate and test the capabilities of AI in generating coherent and contextually relevant conversations.

## Features

- AI-driven conversation: The application simulates a back-and-forth conversation between two AI agents.
- Streamlit-based UI: A user-friendly interface that makes it easy to interact with and monitor the AI agents' dialogue.
